      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>The home page will share the origin of how and why Jakelle's Toy Box came to be. How long it has been running
        and the desire to still continue this tradition. It will also have pictures of Jakelle and another of her family
        at the church that is and still is hosting Jakelle's Christmas Box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jakelles was created in the memory of JaKelle Westergard, who passed away at 17 (1994-2012). Jakelle loved
        both recieving and giving gifts, especially during the Holiday season. This event originally started by her
        family to continue Jakelle's love of giving, now has now grown into a large community event where foster 
        families can shop for free holiday gifts for their children.
