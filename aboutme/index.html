    <p>Hello my name is Shelby, I like to crochet and play games. I'm taking this course to get my degree in cybersecurity. 
        My favorite pattern designer to crochet right now is Lalylala, she's from Germany and has an Etsy and her own website. 
        And couple of my favorite games at the moment are Stardew Valley and Splatoon 3, my favorite mode being Salmon Run in Splatoon 3.</p>
